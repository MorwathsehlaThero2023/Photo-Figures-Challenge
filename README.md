# Photo-Figures-Challenge

The Photo Figures Challenge project demonstrated my ability to combine HTML and CSS to recreate and style various shapes using only HTML elements and CSS properties. By leveraging CSS's box model, positioning, and styling properties, I was able to replicate geometric figures and designs without relying on external graphics. This project showcased my proficiency in CSS and understanding of layout manipulation.
